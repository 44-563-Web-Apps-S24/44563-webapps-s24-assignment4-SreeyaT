ON THE HIGH ROAD a dramatic study </h2>
<h6>FEDYA</h6>
<p>And what are you sticking to him for? He can't do anything and
            you... with your old women's talk... He can't say a word in reply, and
            you're glad, and happy because he's listening to your nonsense...</p>
<p>[Waves his hands] </p>
            
<h6>SAVVA</h6>
<p>Why should I die? Save me, O Lord, from dying in vain.... I'll
            suffer a little, and then get up with God's help.... The Mother of God
            won't let me die in a strange land.... I'll die at home.</p>
            
<h6>FEDYA</h6>
<p> Are you from far off?</p>
            
<h6>SAVVA</h6>
<p> From Vologda. The town itself.... I live there.</p>
            
<h6>FEDYA.</h6>

<p>And where is this Vologda?</p>
            
<h6>TIHON</h6>
<p> The other side of Moscow</p>
            
<h6>FEDYA.</h6>
<p>Well, well, well.... You have come a long way, old man! On foot?</p>
            
<h6>SAVVA.</h6>
<p> On foot, young man. I've been to Tihon of the Don, and I'm going to the Holy Hills.</p>
<p>[Note: On the Donetz, south-east of Kharkov; a monastery containing a miraculous ikon.]</p>
             
            
<h6>FEDYA </h6>
<p> And have you been to Moscow?</p>
            
<h6>SAVVA</h6>
<p>Rather! Five times....</p>
            
<h6>FEDYA</h6>
<p> Is it a good town?</p>
<p>[Smokes]</p> 
<p>Well-standing? Sews. There are many holy places there, young man.... Where there are many holy places
it's always a good town....</p>
            
<h6>BORTSOV</h6>
<p>[Goes up to the counter, to TIHON]</p>
<p> Once more, please! For the sake of Christ, give it to me!</p>
            
<h6>FEDYA </h6>
<p> The chief thing about a town is that it should be clean. If it's dusty, it must be watered; if it's dirty, it must be cleaned. There
ought to be big houses... a theatre... police... cabs, which... I've lived in a town myself, I understand.</p>
