</header>ON THE HIGH ROAD a dramatic study </h2>
<p>FEDYA. And what are you sticking to him for? He can't do anything and
            you... with your old women's talk... He can't say a word in reply, and
            you're glad, and happy because he's listening to your nonsense.... You
            go on sleeping, grandfather; never mind her! Let her talk, don't you
            take any notice of her. A woman's tongue is the devil's broom--it will
            sweep the good man and the clever man both out of the house. Don't
            you mind.... [Waves his hands] But it's thin you are, brother of mine!
            Terrible! Like a dead skeleton! No life in you! Are you really dying?
            
            SAVVA. Why should I die? Save me, O Lord, from dying in vain.... I'll
            suffer a little, and then get up with God's help.... The Mother of God
            won't let me die in a strange land.... I'll die at home.</p>
            
<p>FEDYA. Are you from far off?</p>
            
<p>SAVVA. From Vologda. The town itself.... I live there.</p>
            
<p>FEDYA. And where is this Vologda?</p>
            
<p>TIHON. The other side of Moscow....</p>
            
<p>FEDYA. Well, well, well.... You have come a long way, old man! On foot?</p>
            
<p>SAVVA. On foot, young man. I've been to Tihon of the Don, and I'm
            going to the Holy Hills. [Note: On the Donetz, south-east of Kharkov; a
            monastery containing a miraculous ikon.]... From there, if God wills it,
            to Odessa.... They say you can get to Jerusalem cheap from there, for
            twenty-ones roubles, they say....</p>
            
<p>FEDYA. And have you been to Moscow?</p>
            
<p>SAVVA. Rather! Five times....</p>
            
<p>FEDYA. Is it a good town? [Smokes] Well-standing?</p>
            
<p>Sews. There are many holy places there, young man.... Where there are many holy places
     it's always a good town....</p>
            
<p>BORTSOV. [Goes up to the counter, to TIHON] Once more, please! For the
            sake of Christ, give it to me!</p>
            
<p>FEDYA. The chief thing about a town is that it should be clean. If it's dusty, it must
     be watered; if it's dirty, it must be cleaned. There
    ought to be big houses... a theatre... police... cabs, which... I've
    lived in a town myself, I understand.</p>
